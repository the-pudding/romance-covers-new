Publishers Weekly is a publishing industry magazine specializing in book reviews and known for its spring and fall book announcements."},{"type":"text","value":"Though it sometimes ran announcements in earlier years, the magazine changed its method <a href=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/45023-pw-enlists-above-the-treeline-in-data-collection.html>in spring 2011</a>: they invited publishers to submit new books for consideration through a digital portal and began consistently separating out Romance as a subsection. Of the books submitted, Publishers Weekly <a href=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/45852-spring-2011-announcements-top-10s.html#rom>chose a few per subsection to feature</a>. In Spring 2011, only 10 books were featured per subsection. In <a href=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/47757-fall-2011-announcements-fiction-romance-damsels-who-rescue-themselves.html>subsequent seasons</a>, they featured 47 to 60 romance novels per season including both the Top 10 and featured listings sections. We used percentages to normalize across years."},{"type":"text","value":"I matched the featured titles with their respective covers via the Google Books API. The covers used were those available on Google Books at the original time of analysis. For about 6% of books, the API did not return a complete or clear cover; for these cases we replaced the cover image with those available on Goodreads or other available images with a matching ISBN. One novel announced in 2018 and two in 2023 did not yet have publicly available covers and were excluded."},{"type":"text","value":"All titles submitted by publishers since 2018, including those not featured by Publishers Weekly, <a href=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/announcements/search/index.html>are available for download in a raw form</a>. While that data contains duplicates and some titles that did not have a corresponding image, I encoded the covers for all the titles between 2018 to 2022 to the extent possible. I did so as I recognized that the writer for Publishers Weekly’s romance announcements changed in 2020, potentially impacting their choices. Even so, what they chose became what was signaled to editors, booksellers, librarians, and readers as next up in romance. I also compared the full database of submitted books — not just the featured ones — in these years and saw the same directional shifts, though at more muted levels, as the announcements dataset. Those differences are available on this <a href=https://observablehq.com/@aliceyliang/what-does-a-happily-ever-after-look-like-extension>Observable notebook</a>."},{"type":"text","value":"I then hand coded each cover based on whether someone was partially undressed; whether the style was photorealistic or illustrated; and whether or not there was at least one person of color on the cover. Covers were encoded without knowledge of the listing year."},{"type":"text","value":"Art style guidelines were: “Photorealistic” if the majority of the cover is a photo or painted to plausibly look like a photo; “Illustrated” if otherwise. Undressed guidelines were: “Man partially unclothed” if at least one figure perceived to be a man had at least part of his upper body exposed; “Woman partially unclothed” if at least one figure perceived to be a woman was not wearing a top and/or bottoms, or had partially removed their top and/or bottoms (but could be wearing undergarments). “Racially diverse” guidelines were: If at least one character on the cover is perceived to not be white passing, which can be signified by skin color, hair style, cultural attire, or other characteristics."},{"type":"text","value":"The method was intentionally focused on evaluating information on the cover itself rather than book descriptions. As such, the method has built in limitations: it reflects the idea of what love looks like, from a cover, rather than what it necessarily reads like. Random samples of the encoding were cross-checked by multiple people. Because the covers were meant to be evaluated at a glance — as if you were passing by them in a bookstore or library — this analysis does not completely account for the complexity and fluidity of gender, race, and ethnicity. This is an imperfect method, but by categorizing the covers, we can see important trends within the romance industry — an industry that overwhelmingly features white, cisgender, and heterosexual stories and excludes more marginalized communities."},{"type":"text","value":"We recognize the responsibility that comes with this data.
